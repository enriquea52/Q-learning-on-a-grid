# Q-Learning on a grid map

The present implementation is a solution for path planning on a grid map using Q-learning, a Reinforcement Learning approoach that provides a policy for an agent to follow and reach to the goal by following the shortest path.

The code implementation has a CLI to execute it as follows.

`python main.py` The implementation has an environment (grid map) already embedded so it is required to only execute the **main** file. The the goal location is (17,3). The implementation outputs the original grid map. the resulting value function for each state, the optimal policy (arrows point to the best action to take from a specific state) and the effectiveness graph to understand how the agent learns over time to build the best policy for maximizing reward.
